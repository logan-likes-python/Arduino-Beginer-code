Arduino LED Blink
The Arduino led blink code is the first code you should try in my opinion.
For This Project you will need 
1.	some form of Arduino Iâ€™m using and Arduino uno (amazon.ca) https://cutt.ly/9jfZz4y
2.	Arduino IDE (Free To Download) https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
3.	220k resistor (amazon.ca) https://cutt.ly/5jfZTcT
4.	3.3v LED (amazon.ca) https://cutt.ly/9jfZJiR 
5.	(Optional) A kit with everything you need including tutorials! (amazon.ca) https://cutt.ly/qjfZ7Tp
 
The positive of the led (anode) goes to Pin 13 on your Arduino.
The negative of the led(cathode) goes to your 220k resistor and from the resistor it goes to gnd on your Arduino.
